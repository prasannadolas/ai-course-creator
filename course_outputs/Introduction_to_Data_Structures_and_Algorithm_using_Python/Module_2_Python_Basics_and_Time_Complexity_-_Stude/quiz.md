**Quiz: Python Basics and Time Complexity**

1.  **Which of the following describes Big O notation?**
    a)  The exact execution time of an algorithm in milliseconds.
    b)  The best-case scenario runtime of an algorithm.
    c)  The upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate as input size increases.
    d)  The amount of memory an algorithm uses.

2.  **What is the time complexity of the following Python code snippet?**

    ```python
    def my_function(data):
        for i in range(len(data)):
            print(data[i])
    ```
