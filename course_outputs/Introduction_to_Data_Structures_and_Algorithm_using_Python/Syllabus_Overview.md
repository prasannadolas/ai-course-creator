Okay, I will create a syllabus for "Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms using Python" for beginners, listing 5 modules.

Module 1: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms - Students will learn the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms, understanding their importance in computer science.

Module 2: Python Basics and Time Complexity - Students will review Python fundamentals and explore how to analyze the efficiency of algorithms using Big O notation.

Module 3: Arrays and Linked Lists - Students will learn about arrays and linked lists, two fundamental data structures, including their operations and trade-offs.

Module 4: Stacks, Queues, and Recursion - Students will explore stack and queue data structures, and the concept of recursion.

Module 5: Trees and Graphs Introduction - Students will be introduced to tree and graph data structures, covering basic concepts and their applications.
