1.  What is the core principle of **Supervised Learning**?
    a) The agent learns by exploring its environment through trial and error.
    b) The agent learns from labeled data, where the correct output is known.
    c) The agent discovers patterns in unlabeled data.
    d) The agent uses a pre-defined set of rules to make decisions.

2.  Which machine learning technique is most suitable for enabling an agent to learn to play a game?
    a) Supervised Learning
    b) Unsupervised Learning
    c) Reinforcement Learning
    d) Rule-Based Learning

3.  What is the purpose of the **exploration-exploitation dilemma** in **Reinforcement Learning**?
    a) To balance the agent's need to act quickly with its need to analyze the environment.
    b) To ensure the agent explores the environment to learn new information while also exploiting its current knowledge.
    c) To manage the computational resources used by the agent.
    d) To decide when to apply supervised or unsupervised learning.
