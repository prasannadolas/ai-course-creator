## Module 2: Agent Architectures - Key Concepts Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet provides a quick overview of the essential concepts covered in the "Agent Architectures" module.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Agent Architecture:** The blueprint or design of an agent's control system, dictating how it perceives, reasons, and acts.
*   **Reactive Architecture:** A simple architecture where agents directly respond to their current sensory inputs without using internal models or planning.
*   **Deliberative Architecture:** A more complex architecture involving internal models, planning, and reasoning to make decisions based on past, present, and future considerations.
*   **Hybrid Architecture:** Combines reactive and deliberative approaches to leverage the strengths of both (e.g., fast response and complex planning).
*   **Knowledge Representation:** How an agent stores and structures information about its environment and itself (e.g., using rules, frames, or semantic networks).
*   **Planning:** The process of determining a sequence of actions to achieve a goal.
*   **Situated Agent:** An agent whose actions depend on its environment and sensory inputs, emphasizing the interplay between agent and world.

**Why This Matters:**

*   **Choosing the Right Approach:** Different architectures are suited for different tasks. Knowing the options allows you to design agents that are effective and efficient.
*   **Understanding Agent Behavior:** The architecture defines how an agent thinks and acts. Understanding it predicts and controls behavior.
*   **Building Complex Systems:** Hybrid architectures allow the construction of complex, responsive, and intelligent agents capable of handling diverse real-world situations.
*   **Real-world Applicability:** From robotics to game AI, the choice of architecture shapes the capabilities and performance of AI agents.
*   **Foundation for AI Development:** Architecture is the base to build AI agents.
